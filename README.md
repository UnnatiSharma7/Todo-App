# 📝 Todo App

This project is a **Todo App** built with React and Vite. It allows users to create, manage, and categorize tasks. Users can add tasks, set their priority, and classify them as either Indoor or Outdoor tasks.

## ✨ Features

- **➕ Add Task**: Users can input a task into a text field and add it to the list by pressing a button or pressing Enter.
- **👁️ View Tasks**: Display all added tasks in a list format.
- **🗑️ Delete Task**: Each task has a delete button that removes the task from the list when clicked.
- **🎯 Task Prioritization**: Users can set priorities for tasks (e.g., High, Medium, Low) and display them accordingly.
- **🌦️ Weather Integration: When adding an outdoor task, the app fetches and displays real-time weather data for the user's city using Redux Thunk.
- **💾 Persistent Storage**: Uses local storage or session storage to save tasks and authentication status, ensuring data persistence across browser sessions.
